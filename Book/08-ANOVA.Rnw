\section{Analysis of Variance}

\begin{itemize}
\item
   Two variables: categorical explanatory and quantitative response
   \begin{itemize}
   \item
   Can be used in either experimental or observational designs.
   \end{itemize}
 \item
   Main Question: Does the population mean response  depend on the (treatment) group?

   \begin{itemize}
   \item
   $H_0$: the population group means are all the equal ($\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \cdots \mu_k$)
   \item
   $H_a$: the population group means are not all equal
   \end{itemize}

 \item
   If categorical variable has only 2 values, we already have a method:  2-sample $t$-test

\begin{itemize}
 \item ANOVA allows for 3 or more groups (sub-populations)
 \end{itemize}

 \item $F$ statistic compares within group variation (how different are individuals in the same group?)
 		to between group variation (how different are the different group means?)

 \item
 ANOVA assumes that each group is normally distributed with the same (population) standard deviation.
 \begin{itemize}
 \item Check normality with normal quantile plots (of residuals)
 \item Check equal standard deviation using 2:1 ratio rule 
	 (largest standard deviation at most twice the smallest standard deviation).
 \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

%\subsection*{Why Analyze \emph{Variability} for a Difference in \emph{Means}?}

%Question: Are these differences significant?
%Or would we expect sample differences this large by random chance even 
%if (in the population) the mean amount of shift is equal for all three groups?

%Whether differences between the groups are significant depends on three things:
%
%   \begin{enumerate}
%   \item  the difference in the means
%   \item  the amount of variation within each group
%   \item  the sample sizes
%   \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Partitioning Variability}
   
\subsubsection*{Example 8.3}

<<Example8.3>>=
Ants.Model <- lm (Ants ~ Filling, data = SandwichAnts)
anova(Ants.Model)
@

The p-value listed in this output is the p-value for our null hypothesis that
the mean population response is the same in each treatment group.
In this case we would reject the null hypothesis at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level.

In the next section we'll look at this test in more detail, but notice that if 
you know the assumptions of a test, the null hypothesis being tested, and 
the p-value, you can generally interpret the results even if you don't know 
all the details of how the test statistic is computed.
   
\subsection*{The F-Statistic}

The ANOVA test statistic (called $F$) is based on three ingredients:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
		how different the group means are (between group differences)
	\item
		the amount of variability within each group  (within group differences)
	\item
		sample size
\end{enumerate}

Each of these will be involved in the calculation of $F$.

%Example 8.4

\subsubsection*{Figure 8.3}

<<Figure8.3, cache = TRUE, opts.label = "fig4", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE>>=
Rand.Ants <- do(1000) * anova(lm(Ants ~ shuffle(Filling), data = SandwichAnts))
tally( ~ (F >= 5.63), data = Rand.Ants)
prop( ~ (F >= 5.63), data = Rand.Ants)
gf_dotplot( ~ F, binwidth = 0.20, dotsize = .2, colour = ~(F <= 5.63), data = Rand.Ants)
@

\subsection*{The F-distribution}

Under certain conditions, the $F$ statistic has a known distribution (called the $F$ distribution).  Those conditions 
are
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 
		The null hypothesis is true (i.e., each group has the same mean)
	\item
		Each group is sampled from a normal population
	\item
		Each population group has the same standard deviation
\end{enumerate}
When these conditions are met, we can use the $F$-distribution to compute the p-value without generating 
the randomization distribution.
\begin{itemize}
	\item
$F$ distributions have two parameters -- the degrees of freedom
for the numerator and for the denominator.  

In our example, this is $2$ for the numerator and $7$ for the denominator.  

\item When $H_0$ is true, the numerator and denominator both have a mean of 1, 
	so $F$ will tend to be close to 1.  
	
\item
	When $H_0$ is false, there is more difference between the groups, so the numerator
	tends to be larger.

	This means we will reject the null hypothesis when $F$ gets large enough.

	\item
	The p-value is computed using \function{pf()}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{ANOVA Calculations}

\begin{itemize}
  \item
		Between group variability: 
		\fit{$G = \texttt{groupMean} - \texttt{grandMean}$}

		This measures how different a group is from the overall average.

	\item
		Within group variability: 
		\resid{$E = \texttt{response} - \texttt{groupMean}$}

		This measures how different and individual is from its group average.
		$E$ stands for ``error'', but just as in ``standard error" it is not a 
		``mistake''.  It is simply measure how different an individual response is
		from the model prediction (in this case, the group mean).

		The individual values of \resid{$E$} are called \term{residuals}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example 8.6}

Let's first compute the grand mean and group means.
<<Example8.6>>=
SandwichAnts
mean(~ Ants, data = SandwichAnts)  # grand mean
mean(Ants ~ Filling, data = SandwichAnts)  # group means
@
And add those to our data frame
<<Example8.6b>>=
SA <- transform(SandwichAnts, groupMean = c(30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25, 30.75, 34.00, 49.25) )
SA <- transform(SA, grandMean = rep( 38, 24 ) )
SA
@

<<Example8.6c>>=
SA <- transform(SA, M = groupMean - grandMean)
SA <- transform(SA, E = Ants - groupMean)
SA
@

As we did with variance, we will square these differences:
<<Example8.6d>>=
SA <- transform(SA, M2 = (groupMean - grandMean)^2)
SA <- transform(SA, E2 = (Ants - groupMean)^2)
SA
@

And then add them up (SS stands for ``sum of squares")
<<Example8.6e>>=
SST <- sum( ~((Ants - grandMean)^2), data = SA); SST
SSM <- sum( ~M2, data = SA ); SSM    # also called SSG
SSE <- sum( ~E2, data = SA ); SSE

\section{Pairwise Comparisons and Inference After ANOVA}

\subsection*{Using ANOVA for Inferences about Group Means}

We can construct a confidence interval for any of the means by just 
taking a subset of the data and using \function{t.test()}, but there 
are some problems with this approach.  Most importantly,
\begin{quote}
We were primarily interested in comparing the means across 
the groups.  Often people will display confidence intervals for 
each group and look for ``overlapping'' intervals.  But this is 
not the best way to look for differences.
\end{quote}
Nevertheless, you will sometimes see graphs showing multiple confidence
intervals and labeling them to indicate which means appear to be 
different from which.  (See the solution to problem 15.3 for an example.)

%\subsection*{The Problem of Multiplicity}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\iffalse

The $F$ statistic is a bit complicated to compute.  We'll generally let the computer handle that for us.  But is useful to see one small example to see how the ingredients are baked into a test statistic.

\subsubsection{A Small Dataset}

Suppose we have three groups with the following response values.
\begin{itemize}
   \item  Group A: 5.3, 6.0, 6.7 \hfill [$\bar y_1= 6.0$] 
   \item  Group B: 5.5, 6.2, 6.4, 5.5 \hfill [$\bar y_2= 5.8$]
   \item  Group C: 7.5, 7.2, 7.8 \hfill [$\bar y_3= 7.5$]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Computing $F$}
First, let's represent our small data set in the more usual way:
<<>>=
response <- c( 5.4, 6.1, 6.8, 5.4, 6.1, 6.3, 5.4, 7.5, 7.2, 7.8 )
group <- c( "A","A","A", "B","B","B","B", "C","C","C" )
small <- data.frame( response = response, group = group )
small
@
Now let's compute the grand mean and group means.
<<>>=
mean( response, data = small)  # grand mean
mean( response ~ group, data = small)  # group means
@
And add those to our data frame
<<>>=
small <- transform(small, groupMean = c( 6.1, 6.1, 6.1, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5 ) )
small <- transform(small, grandMean = rep( 6.4, 10 ) )
small
@

Now we are ready to put the ingredients together:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		Between group variability: 
		\fit{$G = \texttt{groupMean} - \texttt{grandMean}$}

		This measures how different a group is from the overall average.

	\item
		Within group variability: 
		\resid{$E = \texttt{response} - \texttt{groupMean}$}

		This measures how different and individual is from its group average.
		$E$ stands for ``error'', but just as in ``standard error" it is not a 
		``mistake''.  It is simply measure how different an individual response is
		from the model prediction (in this case, the group mean).

		The individual values of \resid{$E$} are called \term{residuals}.
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
small <- transform(small, M = groupMean - grandMean)
small <- transform(small, E = response - groupMean)
small
@

As we did with variance, we will square these differences:

<<>>=
small <- transform(small, M2 = (groupMean - grandMean)^2)
small <- transform(small, E2 = (response - groupMean)^2)
small
@

And then add them up (SS stands for ``sum of squares")

<<tidy = FALSE>>=
SSM <- sum( ~M2, data = small ); SSM    # also called SSG
0.16 * 3 + 0.36 * 4 + 1.21 * 3 # alternate way to calculate
SSE <- sum( ~E2, data = small ); SSE
@

Now we adjust for sample size using
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		\fit{$MSM = SSM / DFM = SSM / (\mbox{number of groups} - 1)$}
	\item
		\resid{$MSE = SSE / DFE = SSE / (n - \mbox{number of groups}) $}
\end{itemize}
MS stands for ``mean square"
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
MSM <- SSM / ( 3-1); MSM
MSE <- SSE / (10-3); MSE
@

Finally, our test statistic is 
\[
F = \frac{\fit{MSM}}{\resid{MSE}} 
\]
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
F <- MSM / MSE; F
@

\subsection{P-values from the randomization distribution}

We can now compute a p-value by comparing our value of $F$ (\Sexpr{F}) to a randomization distribution.
If the null hypothesis is true, the three groups are really just one big group and the group labels are 
meaningless, so we can shuffle the group labels to get a randomization distribution:
<<message = FALSE, warning = FALSE>>=
small.rand <- do(1000) * anova(lm( response ~ shuffle(group), data = small ))
tally( ~ (F >= 10.27), data = small.rand )
prop( ~ (F >= 10.27), data = small.rand )
gf_dhistogram( ~ F, bins = 12, data = small.rand) %>%
  gf_vline(xintercept = 10.27)
@

Since our estimated p-value is small, we have enough evidence in the data to reject the null hypothesis.

\subsection{P-values without simulations}

Under certain conditions, the $F$ statistic has a known distribution (called the $F$ distribution).  Those conditions 
are
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
		The null hypothesis is true (i.e., each group has the same mean)
	\item
		Each group is sampled from a normal population
	\item
		Each population group has the same standard deviation
\end{enumerate}
When these conditions are met, we can use the $F$-distribution to compute the p-value without generating 
the randomization distribution.
\begin{itemize}
	\item
$F$ distributions have two parameters -- the degrees of freedom
for the numerator and for the denominator.  

In our example, this is $2$ for the numerator and $7$ for the denominator.  

\item When $H_0$ is true, the numerator and denominator both have a mean of 1, 
	so $F$ will tend to be close to 1.  
	
\item
	When $H_0$ is false, there is more difference between the groups, so the numerator
	tends to be larger.

	This means we will reject the null hypothesis when $F$ gets large enough.

	\item
	The p-value is computed using \function{pf()}.
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
1 - pf(F, 2, 7)
@

\subsection{Getting R to do the work}
Of course, \R\ can do all of this work for us.  We saw this earlier.  Here it is again
in a slightly different way:
<<small-anova-6>>=
small.model <- lm ( response ~ group, small ) 
anova( small.model )
@
\function{lm()} stands for ``linear model" and can be used to fit a wide variety of
situations.  It knows to do 1-way ANOVA by looking at the types of variables involved.

The \function{anova()} prints the ANOVA table.  
Notice how \fit{DFM}, \fit{SSM}, \fit{MSM}, 
\resid{DFE}, \resid{SSE}, and \resid{MSE} show up in this table as well
as $F$ and the p-value.

Here is the ANOVA table for the \dataframe{SandwichAnts} example again:
<<>>=
anova( lm( Ants ~ Filling, data = SandwichAnts ) )
@


\subsubsection{Proportion of Variation Explained}

The \function{summary()} function can be used to provide a different summary
of the ANOVA model:

\begin{small}
<<small-summary-6>>=
summary(small.model)
@
\end{small}

The ratio
\[ 
R^2 = 
\frac{\fit{SSM}}{\fit{SSM} + \resid{SSE}}
= 
\frac{\fit{SSM}}{SST} 
\]
measures the proportion of the total variation that is explained by 
the grouping variable (treatment).  

\subsection{An Example: Jet Lag}

<<blisters-6, echo = FALSE>>=
blisters <- data.frame(
	time = c( 5,6,6,7,7,8,9,10,
              7,7,8,9,9,10,10,11,
              7,9,9,10,10,10,11,12,13),
	treatment = c(rep('A', 8), rep('B', 8), rep('P', 9))
	)
small <- data.frame(
	response = c(
	5.3, 6.0, 6.7, 
	5.5, 6.2, 6.4, 5.7,
	7.5, 7.2, 7.9),
	group = toupper(letters[c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3)])
	)
@

<<jetlag-summary-6>>=
require(abd)
favstats( shift ~ treatment, data = JetLagKnees )
@

<<jetlag1-6, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 4>>=
xyplot( shift ~ treatment, data = JetLagKnees, type = c('p', 'a') )
bwplot( shift ~ treatment, data = JetLagKnees )

gf_point( shift ~ treatment, data = JetLagKnees, type = c('p', 'a') )
gf_boxplot( treatment ~ shift, data = JetLagKnees )
@
\authNote{JetLagKnees data source not found}
<<>>=
jetlag.model <- lm( shift ~ treatment, data = JetLagKnees )
anova(jetlag.model)

@

\subsubsection{Diagnositic Plots}
We can use \function{plot()} to create some diagnostic plots.  The first two are 
the most important for our purposes.  The provide a \term{residual plot} and a 
\term{normal-quantile plot of residuals}.
<<small-plot-6, fig.out = ".47\\textwidth", fig.height = 3.5>>=
plot(small.model, w = 1:2)
@
The residual plot shows the residual broken down by groups (actually by group means).  
Ideally we should see similar patterns of variation in each cluster.
The second plot is a normal-quantile plot of the residuals.  Since the differences 
from the group means should be normally distributed with the same standard deviation, 
we can combine all the residuals into a single normal-quantile plot.  

\subsection{Back to Jet Lag}

Here is all the code needed to analyze the jet lag experiment
\begin{small}
<<jetlag-reprise-6, fig.height = 3.5>>=
jetlag.model <- lm( shift ~ treatment, JetLagKnees )
anova(jetlag.model)
summary(jetlag.model)
plot(jetlag.model, w = 1:2)
@
\end{small}

\section{Confidence Intervals for One Mean At a Time}

We can construct a confidence interval for any of the means by just 
taking a subset of the data and using \function{t.test()}, but there 
are some problems with this approach.  Most importantly,
\begin{quote}
We were primarily interested in comparing the means across 
the groups.  Often people will display confidence intervals for 
each group and look for ``overlapping'' intervals.  But this is 
not the best way to look for differences.
\end{quote}
Nevertheless, you will sometimes see graphs showing multiple confidence
intervals and labeling them to indicate which means appear to be 
different from which.  (See the solution to problem 15.3 for an example.)

\section{Pairwise Comparison}

We really want to compare groups in pairs, and we have a method for this:
2-sample $t$.  But we need to make a couple adjustments to the 
two-sample $t$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
We will use a new formula for standard error that makes use of all the data
(even from groups not involved in the pair).
\item
We also need to adjust the critical value to take into account 
the fact that we are (usually) making multiple comparisons.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Standard Error}

\[SE 
=  \sqrt{MSE \left( \frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j} \right) } 
=  \sqrt{MSE} \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n_i} + \frac{1}{n_j}  } 
\]

where $n_i$ and $n_j$ are the sample sizes for the two groups being 
compared.  Basically, $\sqrt{MSE}$ is taking the place of $s$ in our 
usual formula.
The degrees of freedom for this estimate is 
\[
DFE =  
\mbox{total sample size} - \mbox{number of groups}
\;.
\]

Ignoring the multiple comparisons issue, we can now compute confidence intervals
or hypothesis tests just as before.  

\begin{itemize}
\item confidence interval:  
\[
\mean{y}_i - \mean{y}_j \pm t_* SE
\]
\item test statistic (for $H_0$: $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$):  
\[ t = \frac{ \mean{y}_i - \mean{y}_j }{SE}\;. \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Multiple Comparisons Problem}

Suppose we have 5 groups in our study and we want to make comparisons
between each pair of groups.  That's $4 + 3 + 2 +1 = 10$ pairs.
If we made 10 independent 95\% confidence intervals, the probability
that all of the cover the appropriate parameter is \Sexpr{round(.95^10, 3 )}:
<<>>=
.95^10
@
So we have \term{family-wide error rate} of 
nearly \Sexpr{round(100*(1-.95^10))}\%.

We can correct for this by adjusting our critical value.  Let's take a simple
example: just two 95\% confidence intervals.  
The probability that both cover (assuming independence) is
<<>>=
.95^2
@
Now suppose we want both intervals to cover 95\% instead of 
\Sexpr{round(100 * .95^2, 1)}\% of the time.  We could get this by
forming two \Sexpr{round(100 * sqrt(.95), 1)}\% confidence intervals.
<<>>=
sqrt(.95);
.975^2
@
This means we need a larger value for $t_*$ for each interval.

The ANOVA situation is a little bit more complicated because
\begin{itemize}
\item
There are more than two comparisons.
\item
The different comparisons are not independent (because they all come from
the same data set.)
\end{itemize}

We will briefly describe two ways to make an adjustment for multiple 
comparisons.

\subsection{Bonferroni Corrections -- An Easy Over-adjustment}

Bonferroni's idea is simple:  Simple divide the desired family-wise error rate
by the number of tests or intervals.  This is an over-correction, but it is
easy to do, and is used in many situations where a better method is not known
or a quick estimate is desired.

Here is a table showing a few Bonferroni corrections for 
looking at all pairwise comparisons.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
\hline
number & number of & family-wise & individual & confidence level
\\[-2mm]
groups & pairs of groups & error rate & error rate & for determining $t_*$
\\
\hline
3 & 3 & .05 & \Sexpr{round(.05/3, 3)} & \Sexpr{round( 1 - .05/3, 3)}
\\
4 & 6 & .05 & \Sexpr{round(.05/6, 3)} & \Sexpr{round( 1 - .05/6, 3)}
\\
5 & 10 & .05 & \Sexpr{round(.05/10, 3)} & \Sexpr{round( 1 - .05/10, 3)}
\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Similar adjustments could be made for looking at only a special
subset of the pairwise comparisons.

\subsection{Tukey's Honest Significant Differences}
Tukey's Honest Significant Differences is a better adjustment method
specifically designed for making all pairwise comparisons in 
an ANOVA situation.  (It takes into account the fact that the 
tests are not independent.)
\R\ can compute Tukey's Honest Significant Differences easily.
\begin{center}
<<tukey1-6, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3.0>>=
TukeyHSD ( lm ( shift ~ treatment, JetLagKnees ) )
plot( TukeyHSD ( lm ( shift ~ treatment, JetLagKnees ) ) )
@
\end{center}


%The plot labeling is often poor because it is hard to fit in the long labels
%and the code for this plot was not written particularly carefully.

Tukey's method adjusts the confidence intervals, making them a bit wider, 
to give them the desired family-wide error rate.  
Tukey's method also adjusts p-values (making them larger), so that when the means
are all the same, there is only a 5\% chance that a sample will produce any
p-values below 0.05.

In this example we see that the eye group differs significantly from control
group and also from the knee group, but that the knee and control groups 
are not significantly different.  (We can tell this by seeing which confidence 
intervals contain 0 or by checking which adjusted p-values are less than 0.05.)

\subsection{Other Adjustments}
There are similar methods for testing other sets of multiple comparisons.  
Testing ``one against all the others'' goes by the name of Dunnet's method,
for example.   This is useful when one group represents a control against which
various treatments are being compared.

\subsubsection{A Small Dataset}

Suppose we have three groups with the following response values.
\begin{itemize}
   \item  Group A: 5.3, 6.0, 6.7 \hfill [$\bar y_1= 6.0$] 
   \item  Group B: 5.5, 6.2, 6.4, 5.5 \hfill [$\bar y_2= 5.8$]
   \item  Group C: 7.5, 7.2, 7.8 \hfill [$\bar y_3= 7.5$]
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Computing $F$}
First, let's represent our small data set in the more usual way:
<<>>=
response <- c( 5.4, 6.1, 6.8, 5.4, 6.1, 6.3, 5.4, 7.5, 7.2, 7.8 )
group <- c( "A","A","A", "B","B","B","B", "C","C","C" )
small <- data.frame( response = response, group = group )
small
@
Now let's compute the grand mean and group means.
<<>>=
mean( response, data = small)  # grand mean
mean( response ~ group, data = small)  # group means
@
And add those to our data frame
<<>>=
small <- transform(small, groupMean = c( 6.1, 6.1, 6.1, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 5.8, 7.5, 7.5, 7.5 ) )
small <- transform(small, grandMean = rep( 6.4, 10 ) )
small
@

Now we are ready to put the ingredients together:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
		Between group variability: 
		\fit{$G = \texttt{groupMean} - \texttt{grandMean}$}

		This measures how different a group is from the overall average.

	\item
		Within group variability: 
		\resid{$E = \texttt{response} - \texttt{groupMean}$}

		This measures how different and individual is from its group average.
		$E$ stands for ``error'', but just as in ``standard error" it is not a 
		``mistake''.  It is simply measure how different an individual response is
		from the model prediction (in this case, the group mean).

		The individual values of \resid{$E$} are called \term{residuals}.
\end{itemize}

<<>>=
small <- transform(small, M = groupMean - grandMean)
small <- transform(small, E = response - groupMean)
small
@

As we did with variance, we will square these differences:

<<>>=
small <- transform(small, M2 = (groupMean - grandMean)^2)
small <- transform(small, E2 = (response - groupMean)^2)
small
@

And then add them up (SS stands for ``sum of squares")

<<tidy = FALSE>>=
SSM <- sum( ~M2, data = small ); SSM    # also called SSG
0.16 * 3 + 0.36 * 4 + 1.21 * 3 # alternate way to calculate
SSE <- sum( ~E2, data = small ); SSE
@

Now we adjust for sample size using
\begin{itemize}
	\item
		\fit{$MSM = SSM / DFM = SSM / (\mbox{number of groups} - 1)$}
	\item
		\resid{$MSE = SSE / DFE = SSE / (n - \mbox{number of groups}) $}
\end{itemize}
MS stands for ``mean square"
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
MSM <- SSM / ( 3-1); MSM
MSE <- SSE / (10-3); MSE
@

Finally, our test statistic is 
\[
F = \frac{\fit{MSM}}{\resid{MSE}} 
\]
<<tidy = FALSE>>=
F <- MSM / MSE; F
@
